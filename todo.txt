divide sea provinces
	TTA has a max sea province size of 128,000 px.
	I have to reduce the size of my sea provinces.

replace text/symbols in load_5.dds with almean ones

fix party start/end dates in common/countries/...txt

land province HARD SIZE LIMIT = 20,000 pixels
	I will need to create at least 23 provinces for west erelae
sea province HARD SIZE LIMIT >= 70,000 pixels
	there are vanilla tiles approaching this amount

remaining land:
	- MAYBE Xengiman - but doubtful
	- barbarian plain
	- West Erelae
