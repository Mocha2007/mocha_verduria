years: add 1700 to our year - based on http://www.zompist.com/vermodern.htm
	3485 = 1785 (+1700 steam locomotive)
	3543 = 1818 (+1725 Bicycle)
	3588 = 1903 (+1685 Airplane)
	3640 = 1940 (+1700 Bullet Train)

divide sea provinces
	Through testing I have found a size of 1,831,611 px. is SAFE

replace text/symbols in load_5.dds with almean ones

fix party start/end dates in common/countries/...txt

land province HARD SIZE LIMIT => 114,662 pixels (Siberia in vanilla)
sea province HARD SIZE LIMIT >= 100,294 pixels (Pacific in vanilla)

remaining land:
	- MAYBE Xengiman - but doubtful
	- MAYBE barbarian plain - but doubtful
	- West Erelae
		>= 23 provinces
sea:
	~89 provinces

potential issues for why the crash happens:
	- missing pops
		nope, tested: missing pops do not cause a crash
	- missing newline at the end of a province file, or some other file
		nope, all good
	- invalid positions in positions.txt
		nope, vanilla map works even with positions deleted, it has defaults apparently
	- terrain / province map mismatch???
		everything appears correct
	- do + intersections in the province map cause crashes (make sure there's no four-corner provinces like AZ/NM/CO/UT)
		nope, my other mod does this just fine
	- missing trade goods (economy crashes?)
	- missing oob files?
		nope, added REB but still crashes
	- (try checking what the loading screen says in vanilla vicky when starting a new game)
		- "Adapting History..." and that's it
	- I tried using the vanilla map, but the same crash occurs, so I'm 99% sure it's not with the map but with something else

FORGOTTEN:
	- I forgot Azgami between Erenat and Ismahi on the coast of Eretald
