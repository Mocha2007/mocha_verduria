divide sea provinces
	Through testing I have found a size of 1,831,611 px. is SAFE

replace text/symbols in load_5.dds with almean ones

fix party start/end dates in common/countries/...txt

land province HARD SIZE LIMIT = 20,000 pixels
	I will need to create at least 23 provinces for west erelae
sea province HARD SIZE LIMIT >= 128,678 pixels
	TTA has a sea tile this size without issue

remaining land:
	- MAYBE Xengiman - but doubtful
	- MAYBE barbarian plain - but doubtful
	- West Erelae
		>= 23 provinces
sea:
	~89 provinces

FORGOTTEN:
	- I forgot Azgami between Erenat and Ismahi on the coast of Eretald
